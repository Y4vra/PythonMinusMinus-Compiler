PROGRAM
========
A program is a sequence of definitions.
The definitions can be for variables or functions.

VARIABLE DEFINITION
======================
The syntax for defining a variable is a list,
with at least one element, of identifiers separated by commas
followed by ':' and a type.
Variable definitions end with the character ;

FUNCTION DEFINITION
======================
Functions are defined using the reserved word "def", followed
by the function identifier, a list of parameters separated
by commas between '(' and ')', followed by '->' and the return type
or "None" (if it does not return anything), and finally ":".

The return type and the parameters must be of a simple type
(no arrays or records are allowed).
The function body is enclosed between '{' and '}'.
The body of the function consists of a sequence of zero
or more variable definitions followed by a sequence of zero
or more statements.
In both cases, they end with the character ;.
The "main" function does not return anything, does not receive parameters,
and must necessarily be declared last.

TYPES
=====
The simple types are "int", "double", and "char".
Arrays can be created with the type constructor [],
specifying the size with an integer constant (as in C),
followed by any type.
The type constructor struct is used to create records.
Records do not have an identifier, and the fields are declared
as variables within {}. Type definitions (e.g., typedef) are not allowed.

STATEMENTS
==========
A write operation is the reserved word "print" followed by a list of one or more expressions separated by commas.
A read operation is the reserved word "input" followed by a list of one or more expressions separated by commas.
An assignment consists of two expressions separated by the = operator.
The if-else conditional statement and the while loop follow the Python language syntax (without parentheses and with : after the condition and else).
In both cases, the body follows Java-like syntax: the statements are enclosed in {} and, if there is only one statement, the braces can be omitted.
The statement return <expression> is allowed (the expression is mandatory).
A function call with no return value (referred to as a procedure) is always treated as a statement.

EXPRESSIONS
===========
A function call is considered an expression when it returns a value.
Explicit type conversion (cast) is done using C-style syntax.

Expressions are formed by:
Integer, real, and unsigned character constants.
Identifiers.

The following operators applied to one or two expressions (in descending order of precedence):

( ) — Non-associative

[] — Non-associative

. — Left-associative

CAST — Non-associative

- (unary) — Non-associative

! — Non-associative

* / % — Left-associative

+ - — Left-associative

> >= < <= != == — Left-associative

&& || — Left-associative
