# Python-- Compiler
## Overview

The Python-- compiler translates code written in Python--, a theoretical programming language combining Python and C++ syntax, into MAPL, an intermediate representation language for academic purposes. The goal of this project was to learn and develop a basic yet complete compiler, mimicking a real one's behaviour.

## Language Specification
Check the documentation folder to see both the languaje specification and MAPL code generation, as well as the UML diagram of the compiler.

## Code examples
Several code examples to test the behaviour of the compiler are on the examples folder.
Here is one:
```
   v:[10]double;

# Main program
def main()->None: {
	value:double;
	i,j:int;
	w:[4][5]int;
	date:struct { 
		day, month, year:int;		
	};
	
	input date.day; 
	date.year = (int)'a'; 
	date.month = date.day*date.year%12+1;
	print date.day, '\n', date.month, '\n', (double)(date.year), '\n';
	
	input value;
		
	i=0;	
	while i<10: {
		v[i]=value;
		print i,':',v[i], ' ';
		if i%2:
			print 'o','d','d','\n';
		else:
			print 'e','v','e','n','\n';
		i=i+1;
	}
	print '\n';

	i=0;
	while i<4: {
		j=0;
		while j<5: {
			w[i][j]=i+j;
			print w[i][j], ' ';
			j=j+1;
		}
		print '\n';
		i=i+1;
	}
}
```
